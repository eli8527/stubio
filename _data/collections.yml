  description: <p>The Unique Clothes are based on clothing purchasable at UNIQLO.
    Originally founded in 1984 as "Unique Clothing Warehouse," an administrative error
    caused the firm to be registered not as UNICLO but instead as UNIQLO. Since then,
    the fast retail, fast fashion company has gone on to produce clothing that is
    anything but unique. In fact, mass production and mechanization has perhaps led
    to a new definition of the term unique. stubio is interested in perusing UNIQLO's
    various wares and creating clothing that is perhaps, somewhat unique.</p>
