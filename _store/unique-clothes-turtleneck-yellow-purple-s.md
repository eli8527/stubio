description: <p>The Unique Clothes Turtleneck is produced in a handful of color combinations
  based on UNIQLO's U line of Oversized Mock Necks. These color pairs are hand picked
  and sewn and are produced in an initial limited edition. They are an exercise in
  found color combinations, but as clothing. We suggest <a href="kmbag.nl" title="">KMbag</a>
  as a complementary accessory for the shirt.</p><p>The Unique Clothes are based on
  clothing purchasable at UNIQLO. Originally founded in 1984 as "Unique Clothing Warehouse,"
  an administrative error caused the firm to be registered not as UNICLO but instead
  as UNIQLO. Since then, the fast retail, fast fashion company has gone on to produce
  clothing that is anything but unique. In fact, mass production and mechanization
  has perhaps led to a new definition of the term unique. Studio B is interested in
  perusing UNIQLO's various wares and creating clothing that is perhaps, somewhat
  unique.</p><p>"Always evolving, always experimenting."</p>
