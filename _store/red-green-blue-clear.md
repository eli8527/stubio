description: <p>Measures 2.7"</p><p>Marbled Ornaments is a collection of somewhat
  untraditional holiday ornaments. they are marbled by hand. while marbling is generally
  used for bookbinding, or on <a href="https://www.publicartfund.org/view/exhibitions/6640_tauba_auerbach_flow_separation">ships</a>,
  we choose to use this technique instead of the usual mass produced sparkles and
  colorful stripes. the design is entirely up to chance. or fluid dynamics, more so.
  you will find that each ornament is unique, with our only real intervention being
  the choice of colors.</p>
