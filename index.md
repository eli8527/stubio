  workshop of Eric Li and Kelly Tan. Our opening collection includes Unique Clothes
  and marbled ornaments. Enjoy!! A busy holiday season for all... This site is a work
  in progress, but feel free to browse and purchase things at your leisure. Our first
  collection is called 750 sq ft, which is the current square footage of our apartment.
  As we move around, we will introduce new collections, again based on the area in
  which we work. Listen to some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXJWO2FQ16c"
