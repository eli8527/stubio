header: <p><a href="/" title=""><strong>stubio</strong></a> Hello. stubio is the collaborative
  workshop of Eric Li and Kelly Tan. Our opening collection includes Unique Clothes
  and marbled ornaments. Enjoy!! A busy holiday season for all... Kelly is currently
  taking pictures for this site! We are currently watching Brooklyn Nine-Nine while
  making this happen. This site is a work in progress, but feel free to browse and
  purchase things at your leisure. Our first collection is called 750 sq ft, which
  is the current square footage of our apartment. As we move around, we will introduce
  new collections, again based on the area in which we work. Listen to some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXJWO2FQ16c"
